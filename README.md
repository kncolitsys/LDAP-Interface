### Distinguished Names

> **TIP** to sort out your config you'll need to get to grips with the concept of Distinguished Names.. its how LDAP identifies objects in its directory.

The LDAP API references an LDAP object by its distinguished name (DN). A DN is a sequence of relative distinguished names (RDN) connected by commas.
